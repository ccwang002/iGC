To demonstrate the usage of the iGC package, the package bundles example data from 50 breast cancer samples. We selected a subset of a microarray dataset containing 523 breast cancer samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) in the format of level three. This dataset is called as pairedbr. It contains the GE and the CN data from the same individual concurrently.
